# ENS-resolution-delays
 I worked as part of the Information and Communication Engineering research group at UCL EEE on a project to research, design, and implement a comparative performance analysis of popular blockchain name registry services such as ENS (Ethereum Name Service) compared to the DNS (Domain Name System).

I gained valuable first-hand technical experience in the field. Here is a list of some of the things I accomplished/learnt during the project:
- Learning a new programming language (Go by Google) in order to use relevant online modules such as go-ens and go-ipfs-api.
- Solving numerous dependency issues that arise with installing and configuring software programs such as Go, Git, Geth, Goland, IPFS Desktop, and others.
- Learning how to connect to the Ethereum blockchain using different methods such as gateways (e.g. via Infura) or locally installed nodes (e.g. via Geth). 
- Significantly improved my Command Line Interface skills as a result of using Git, Go, and Geth.
- Became more comfortable and experienced with using GitHub by working on the same project with other contributors. 
- Creating a domain on the GÃ¶rli Ethereum testnet in order to learn how to upload and fetch content from the domain using IPFS (Interplanetary File System) and Go.
- Compiling a list of ENS domains with a CID (Content Identifier), then measuring the resolution delays using three different methods to access the Ethereum blockchain.
- Comparing the ENS resolution delays with its DNS counterpart by resolving a list of DNS domains using Python.
